# Lml-Eco
Hello, Lml Also Known As Eco Is A Fictional Programming Language
Lml Stands For Left Means Left And Eco Stands For Elastic Coding Object
Lml And Eco Is The Same.
I Don't Really Know What Programming Language Is Similar To This.
Lml/Eco From What I Can Tell Maybe Could Be The Plot Of The Story, Like A Json File For A Minecraft Addon Mob.
Also, Please Download The File Below For An Example Of Lml/Eco Text
